# RTL-Simulator

Register Transfer Language (RTL) is a kind of intermediate representation (IR) that is used as an architecture-neutral assembly language. 

This software provides simulation, debugging, and generating synthesizable HDL code for an RTL code. All RT operations are supported. The software provides rich GUI and is quite easy to use. Meanwhile, it is slightly slow, since the performance was not the main consideration of this project. 

Please refer to [User's Manual](https://github.com/bakhshalipour/RTL-Simulator/blob/master/User's%20Manual.pdf) for more information.
